# Alorithm Design Project

This is a project heavily based on the book [Algorithm Design Manual](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/425208.The_Algorithm_Design_Manual) by Steven Skiena.

The project will contain solutions in different programming languages. The first set of lanuages that we will focus on will be python, c++ and c. Others may be added.

The directory algo_pack has a variety of algorithms not necessarily found in the book mentioned above.
